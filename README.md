# Bard

Tired of unstable, feature packed PHP sitemap packages?
 
 **Look no more!** 
 
 Bard is the simplest PHP Sitemap package, just add some urls and you are ready to go. Did I mention that it supports multilingual locations aka hreflangs. 
 
 **But wait, there is more.** 
 
 If you are using Laravel you'll have access to some extra awesomeness with convenient helper functions that make creating sitemaps a breeze.
